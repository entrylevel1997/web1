        <h3>Introduction of IMB</h3>
        <p>Developed in close collaboration with some of the UK’s most well-known companies, this pioneering degree programme offers
        a distinctive balance of IT, Management, and Business to ensure that you have the skills and expertise needed to thrive in the industries of the future.
        At every level, <strong>UCL’s Information Management for Business (IMB)</strong> undergraduate degree programme is underpinned by emerging research
        and practice. The School of Management focuses on the impact of innovation, new technologies, analytics, and entrepreneurship
        on business transformation. It delivers world-class research through four research groups: Organisations & Innovation,
        Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Operations & Technology, and Marketing & Analytics. These provide the cutting-edge context within
        which the IMB programme has been developed and continues to evolve.</p>
        <p>This programme, which is a business and management degree programme, benefits from the close collaboration and know-how provided
        by our colleagues in the Department of Information Studies (DIS), an international centre for knowledge creation and transfer,
        whose research aims to develop the understanding and insights needed to shape the emerging information environment.
        Hence, alongside the development of analytical tools and modelling skills appropriate to the business applications of IT the IMB degree
        is designed to develop you as an independent thinker and as a confident and creative problem solver who is ready and able to contribute
        to the next wave of business transformation.</p>
