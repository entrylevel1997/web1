  <h2>HTML 이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" title="HTML specification">
    <strong>The HyperText Markup Language</strong></a>,
    or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
    It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
    scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a
    web server or from local storage and render
    the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web
    page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
    images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
    rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
    structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
    and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
