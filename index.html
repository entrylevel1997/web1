  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank"><strong>The World Wide Web (WWW)</strong></a>,
  commonly known as The Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources
  are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as <a href="https://example.com/"
  target="_blank">https://example.com/</a>), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks,
  and are accessible over the Internet.<br>[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred
  via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software
  application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called
  a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated
  the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies
  the Web is built.</p>
